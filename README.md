# Repl Identity

(for Typescript/Javascript!)

From [go-replidentity](https://github.com/replit/go-replidentity)

> Repl Identity stores a REPL_IDENTITY token in every Repl automatically. This token is a signed PASETO that includes verifiable repl identity data (such as the user in the repl, and the repl ID).
> 
> **WARNING: in their current form, these tokens are very forwardable! You should only send these tokens to repls that you trust, or between repls that you own.**
> 
> This package provides the necessary code to verify these tokens.
> 
> Check the example at tests/identity.test.js for an example usage. You can also see this in action at https://replit.com/@RayhanADev/replidentity-lib. If you are logged in to Replit, you'll see your username when you click "Run" on the Cover Page - that's Repl Identity at work.
